# âš¡ serverless-s3-sftp-sync

Sync folder and file between S3 and SFTP as the following mechanism:

- For S3 => SFTP: use S3 Put Event to trigger Lambda function. This function will get S3 object as readable stream, then put it to SFTP
- For SFTP => S3: use schedule trigger to get which files need to be synced to S3 from SFTP. After finding these files, their name will be put into SQS. There will be Lambda which will be triggered when new message is pushed into this SQS. Then, in these Lambda, they will be get file from SFTP as stream then put to S3.

By implementing mechanism, we can leverage of SQS + Lambda to handle in case that there are many file need to synced.
